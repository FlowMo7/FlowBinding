# Change Log

## Version 0.5.0

_2019-10-28_

This is the initial release of FlowBinding - Kotlin Flow binding APIs for Android's platform and unbundled UI widgets.

Please note that while the library is heavily tested with instrumented tests, the APIs are not yet stable. Our plan is to polish the library by adding missing bindings and fixing bugs as we work towards 1.0.

* New: **flowbinding-android** artifact - provides Flow bindings for the Android platform APIs.
